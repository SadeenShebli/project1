#Write a simple program that will read the input r which indicate redies of the circle and calculate the area and the circumference of that circle ?
#Area = pi * r ^2
#Cir = Pi * 2 * r


r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
pi = 3.14

circumference = 2 * pi * r

print("The area of the circle is:", (area, 2))
print("The circumference of the circle is:", (circumference, 2))
